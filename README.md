# pyReef-Core

**pyReef-Core** is a deterministic, one-dimensional (1-D) numerical model, that simulates the vertical coralgal growth patterns observed in a drill core, as well as the physical, environmental processes that effect coralgal growth. The model is capable of integrating ecological processes like coralgal community interactions over centennial-to-millennial scales using predator-prey or _Generalised Lotka-Volterra Equations_.

_Schematic figure of a hypothetical reef with transitions from shallow to deep assemblages occurring down-core, illustrating growth-form responses of corals to environmental forcing including light, sea level changes (**sl**), hydrodynamic energy (**w** wave conditions and **c** currents) and sediment flux. Note that other factors contributing to accommodation have been excluded for simplicity._


## Generalized Lotka-Volterra model

The most common models of species evolution in ecological modeling are the predator-prey **Lotka-Volterra (LV)** equation and its modifications.

From LV equations, one can formulate the **Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV)** equation that allows unlimited number of species and different types of interactions among species. The GLV equation is mainly formed by two parts, the logistic growth/decay of a species and its interaction with the other species,

## Definition of species rate and community matrix

To solve the ODEs, the user needs to define several initial conditions:

- the initial species population number <img src="https://rawgit.com/pyReef-model/pyReefCore/master/mfigs/8058174c3e47972feecfee6a81720995.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=23.046375pt height=22.38192pt/>
- the intrinsic rate of a population species <img src="https://rawgit.com/pyReef-model/pyReefCore/master/mfigs/7ccca27b5ccc533a2dd72dc6fa28ed84.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=6.6475035pt height=14.10255pt/>
- the interaction coefficients among the species association <img src="https://rawgit.com/pyReef-model/pyReefCore/master/mfigs/c745b9b57c145ec5577b82542b2df546.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=10.537065pt height=14.10255pt/>

Several other input are required and will need to be set in the **XmL** inputfile. An example of such file is provided [here](https://github.com/pyReef-model/pyReefCore/blob/master/Tests/input.xml).

## Solving the ODEs system

The mathematical model for the species population evolution results in a set of differential equations (ODEs), one for each species associations modeled. The **Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg** method (_RKF45_ or _Fehlberg_ as defined in the [**odespy**](http://hplgit.github.io/odespy/doc/pub/tutorial/html/main_odespy.html) library) is used to solve the **GLV ODE system**.

## Carbonate production

Once a species association population is computed, carbonate production is calculated using a carbonate production factor. Production factors are specified for the maximum population, and linearly scaled to the actual population following the relation

which gives:

We define the maximum carbonate production rate (m/y) for each species in the **XmL** input file.


## Model workflow

</div>

Illustration outlining **PyReef-Core** workflow (left) and of the resulting simulated core (right). First boundary conditions for sea level, sediment input and flow velocity are set, which describes their relationship to either depth or time. The boundary conditions are used to establish the environment factor ùëìùëíùëõùë£ which describes the proportion of the maximum growth rate that an assemblage can achieve, depending on whether the environmental conditions exceed the optimal conditions for growth. The environment factor is set to scale the Malthusian parameter, which is in turn used as input in the GLVE equations to determine assemblage populations. Larger assemblage populations contribute to a faster rate of vertical accretion (here referred to as carbonate production). At the end of the timestep, boundary conditions are updated and the process is repeated.

## Examples

A series of examples are shipped with the code and can form the basis for defining your own case.

Using the XmL input file you will be able to calibrate the environmental threshold functions for different assemblages. Figure below shows an example of calibration for shallow, moderate-deep and deep assemblages characteristic of a synthetic exposed margin. The x-axis indicates the limitation on maximum vertical accretion for conditions outside the optimal, 100% maximum growth window, indicated for clarity for the moderate-deep assemblage.
